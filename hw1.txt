Consider a MAIL_ORDER database in which employees take orders for parts from customers. The data requirements are summarized as follows:

- The mail order company has employees-- employee number, name, date of hire, and zip code, identified by employee number
- Each customer of the company is identified by a unique customer number and has the following information recorded: name, street, zip code and phone number. 
- Each parts sold by the company is identified by a unique part number and has the following  information: a part name, price and quantity on stock.
- Each order placed by a customer is taken by an employee and is given a unique number. Each order contains specified quantities of one or more parts. Each order has a date of receipt as well as expected ship date. The actual ship date is also recorded.

Your tasks:

a) Draw an ER Diagram for this situation. State any assumptions that you have made. 
b) Convert your design to relational schemas.
