=========================================

****** Due: 11:59pm, Oct. 7.******
****** Points: 45 points
****** Submit a soft copy to the Blackboard.  ****** 
****** You may work in a group of 2 ******


1. (10 points) Suppose that a disk unit has the following parameters: seek time s = 20 msec; rotational delay rd = 10 msec; block transfer time btt = 1 msec; block size B = 4096 bytes. An EMPLOYEE file has the following fields: Ssn, 9 bytes; Last_name, 20 bytes; First_name, 20 bytes; Middle_init,1 byte; Birth_date, 10 bytes; Address, 35 bytes; Phone, 12 bytes; Supervisor_ssn, 9 bytes; Department, 4 bytes; Job_code, 4 bytes; deletion marker, 1 byte. The EMPLOYEE file has r = 30,000 records, fixed-length format, and unspanned blocking. Write appropriate formulas and calculate the following values for the above EMPLOYEE file:

s = 20 msec
rd = 10 msec
btt = 1 ms
B = 4096


fields: 
Ssn, 9 bytes; 
Last_name, 20 bytes; 
First_name, 20 bytes; 
Middle_init,1 byte; 
Birth_date, 10 bytes; 
Address, 35 bytes;
Phone, 12 bytes; 
Supervisor_ssn, 9 bytes; 
Department, 4 bytes; 
Job_code, 4 bytes; 
deletion marker, 1 byte


a) Calculate the record size R in bytes
9 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 35 + 12 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 125 = R

b) Calculate the blocking factor bfr and the number of file blocks b, assuming an unspanned organization.
bfr = floor( 4906 / R )  = 32
b = ceil( 30000/ 32 ) = 938

c) Calculate the time it takes to linear search for a record given its Ssn value.  You may assume data blocks are stored on the disk consecutively.
"This requires reading and searching half the file blocks on the average, and is hence quite expensive."
Seek time only and rotational delay only occur once.

(938/1 * 1) + 30 = 499 ms = .938 sec ( worst case )
(938/2 * 1) + 30 = 499 ms = .499 sec ( avg case )

d) Assume a B+ index is created on Ssn and also assume the size of disk/block pointer is 4 bytes. Calculate 1) the maximum number of pointers/children for internal nodes, and 2) the time it takes to search for a record given its Ssn value. 

ssn, 9 bytes;     //V
pointer, 4 bytes; //p

(n)*4 + (n-1)*9 = 4096
4n + 9n - 9 = 4096
13n = 4105
n = 315

1) n=315
2) k = search values in file N = key vlaues = 30000
H = logN/2 (K)  = 3

3 * (20 + 10 + 1) = 93 ms


Notes:
. Block transfer time (btt): Once the read/write head is at the beginning of the required block, the time is needed to transfer the data in the block.
. Unspanned organization: If records are not allowed to cross block boundaries, the organization is called unspanned.
. blocking factor bfr: the number of records that can be stored in one data block.


2. (10 points) Consider the following relational schema:

   Course(courseName unique, department, instrID)
   Instructor(instrID unique, office)
   Student(studentID unique, major)
   
   Enroll(studentID, courseName, unique (studentID,courseName))

Suppose there are five types of queries commonly asked on this schema:

    a)Given a course name, find the department offering that course.
    b)List all studentIDs together with all of the departments they are taking courses in.
    c)Given a studentID, find the names of all courses the student is enrolled in.
    d)List the offices of instructors teaching at least one course.
    e)Given a major, return the studentIDs of students in that major.

Suppose there are four indexes defined:
	1) Index on Student.major 
	2) Index on Instructor.office 
	3) Index on Course.courseName
	4) Index on Enroll.courseName

For each query a)-e)above, indicate which index or indexes are useful in speeding up the exectution. If none of the four indexes is useful in answering a query, specify one index that can be used to improve the performance for that query.

ANSWERS------
-------------
a) 3, Course.courseName
b) 4, Index on Enroll.courseName and 2, Course.courseName
c) New index? 
d) 2, Instructor.office and 3, Course.courseName
e) 1, Student.major 


3. (10 points) Consider a table storing temperature readings taken by sensors:

   Temps(sensorID, time, temp)

Assume the pair of attributes [sensorID,time] is a key. Consider the following query:

   select * from Temps
   where sensorID = 'sensor541'
   and time = '05:11:02'

Consider the following scenarios:

A - No index is present on any attribute of Temps
B - An index is present on attribute sensorID only
C - An index is present on attribute time only
D - Separate indexes are present on attributes sensorID and time
E - A multi-attribute index is present on (sensorID,time)

Suppose table Temps has 50 unique sensorIDs and each sensorID has exactly 20 readings. Furthermore there are exactly 10 readings for every unique time in Temps.

For each scenario A-E, determine the maximum number of tuples that might be accessed to answer the query, assuming one "best" index is used whenever possible. (Don't count the number of index accesses.) 

ANSWERS------
-------------
a) All 1000 would need to be accessed and checked for sensor id and time. 
b) Only the readings for a given sensor would need to be checked for time. 20. 
c) Only the would need to be checked sensors for a given time. 10.
d) None, just look at the intersection from the output of each of the indexes
e) One? as it would point directly to the index group for the time?


4.(5 points) Consider a relation stored as a randomly ordered file for which the only index is an unclustered index on a field called sal. If you want to retrieve all records with sal>20, is using the index  always  the best alternative? Explain.

ANSWER-------
-------------
Randomly ordered file, without indexing, would cause you to need to search all entries. 
With an unclustered index on sal, you are able to simply use the ordering of the index to determine where sal > 20. The unclustered index is sorted. 


5. (10 points) Relational algebra problems: 
Consider the following relations:
employee(person_name, street, city)
works(person_name, company_name, salary)
company(company_name, city)

Construct an expression in the relational algebra to express each of the following queries:

a) Find the name of each employee who lives in city "Miami".
b) Find the name of each employee whose salary is greater than $100000.
c) Find the name of each employee who lives in "Miami" and whose salary is greater than $100000.
